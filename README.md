- React JS: Front end library used for making this very single page application. Wiindy â€“ The Weather App.
    - Functional Components: Functional components are just simple functions which are used to pass data and props, and export data from one component to another while working with react.
    - React Props: React props are used in this project to pass data among components which define their on-screen values, and styles such as size, colour etc.
    - useState Hook: useState hook is used to store the initial state/value and changed/updated state/value of data.
    - useEffect Hook: useEffect hook is used to verify if the data/component has been changed, and if the data is added to the variable.
    - useContext Hook: useContext is used to pass data among components which can be accessed throughout the component hierarchy without passing data through the props.
<br/>
<br/>

- React Icons (react-icons.github.io): Icons utilized as ES6 imports for the project. I used React Icons because they offer various icons for free, and most importantly, we can import those icons only which are needed by us as ES6 imports.
<br/>
<br/>

- Axios: Axios is a library used to make requests to the API, return data from API, and do something when data is received. I used axios in addition to async await method to make the API request to Openweathermap and Accuweather endpoints Asynchronously.
    - Axios.Get: This command performs HTTP request.
    - Axios.Spread: This command is used to spread the array of received arguments into multiple arguments.
    - Axios.All: This command is used to make concurrent HTTP requests.

<br/>

- HTML/CSS/Javascript
  
<br/>

- SASS 
    - Skeleton CSS: A pseudonym for the animation used in pre-loading the content.
    - Nesting: A feature of SASS where elements can be nested inside one another in order to justify which child belongs to which parent.
    - Variables: A variable can be made by using $-Dollar sign which can be of any name. This variable can be then used over and over again in different parts of the document to apply styles to different elements. (It needs to be at least a parent of element where the style is going to apply)
